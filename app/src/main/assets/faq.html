					<div class="cd-faq__content">
						<div class="text-component">
							<p>HandMeDown is for anything edible, no matter if loose, raw, cooked, opened,
								unopened… etc. There are
								guidelines, but generally speaking, if it’s food you would eat, then it’s okay
								for HandMeDown. For
								example,
								see what was added on HandMeDown last week.
								You can also add
								<ul>
									<li>Food that has already been opened which is not sealed pack.</li>
									<li>Food that is past its ‘Best Before’ date</li>
									This date refers to the quality and shelf life of a product, not safety.
									However, please only add
									items that you would be willing to eat yourself. You can read more about
									Best Before dates on this
									Government web site here
									<li>Alcohol</li>
									It is also your responsibility to ensure the person you are giving the
									alcohol to is of legal drinking
									age in your country.
									<li>Baby formula</li>
									HandMeDown agrees with government advice that breast milk is best for
									babies and breastfeeding should
									continue for as long as possible. Infant milks should only be used on the
									advice of a doctor, midwife,
									health visitor, public health nurse, dietitian, pharmacist, or other
									professionals responsible for
									maternal and child care. HandMeDown does not advertise or promote the use
									of infant or follow-on
									formulae
									but is happy for you to share surplus infant and follow on formulae with
									parents who have already made
									the informed choice to use such products. The sole purpose of HandMeDown is
									to help to reduce food
									waste.
